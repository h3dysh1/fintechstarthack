Inspiration //
We were inspired by the shocking statistic that the financial literacy rates of young Australians decrease 14% year by year. To address this national crisis, we created an application that is powering the future of finance for young people so that we can have an inclusive financial future.

What it does //
FinBear is an app that gamifies personal finance learning to be engaging and fun for users. Users learn through challenges, flashcards, and simulations to gain knowledge of the most relevant finance topics for young people.

How we built it //
We built FinBear through python; using Flask for the backend and authentication, Peewe for our database, and Bootstrap for our frontend. After creating a final product, we then deployed it on Vercel.

Challenges we ran into // 
Our biggest challenge that we encountered in the development of our application was learning the appropriate core technologies to code our solution in Python. Being first year students, we had limited expertise at developing full-functioning web applications to deploy at a wide-scale.

Accomplishments that we're proud of //
We are proud of producing a fully-functioning web application that utilises core technologies in software. We are also proud of our first-hand solution that addresses a critical issuewithin Australia, and our ability to help pave the way for a more literate future.

What we learned //
We have found joy in this learning experience and are proud of the growth of our skillset. Upon research and initiative, we developed skills to integrate different technologies to create software. Starting from the ground up, we were able to learn about different libraries, creating packages and deploying web applications. This included learning Flask, Bootstrap, Peewe, and learning Html to create a successful ecosystem to run a functional application.

What's next for FinBear //
We plan on integrating a fully functional AI assistant to further personalise the userâ€™s learning journey. This would include working and licensing ChatGPT to be a part of our technology infrastructure, and prompt engineering to relay accurate information. We also hope to develop a newsletter system to expose students to wider personal finance knowledge and opportunities to grow their understanding. With each development, we hope to achieve a more literate and smarter future.
